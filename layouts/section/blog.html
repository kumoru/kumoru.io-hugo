      <p class="white f3-ns f4 fw3 lh-copy">Hey, thanks for checking us out. We've worked really hard on this, and we're thrilled to finally be sharing it with the world at large.</p>
      <p class="white f3-ns f4 fw3 lh-copy">Kumoru.io was born from two major frustrations:
        <ul class="white f3-ns f4 fw3 lh-copy">
          <li>First, it should be easier for developers to get their application deployed without having to mess around with infrastructure.</li>
          <li>Second, existing solutions have some glaring issues: restricted languages/libraries, not allowing for capacity efficiencies and locking you into a single provider.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p class="white f3-ns f4 fw3 lh-copy">We have big ideas on how to solve these issues, and our end goal is to create a platform that enables a future without infrastructure.</p>

    <h3 class="f1-ns f2 k-dark-green">What is Kumoru?</h3>

    <p class="f3-ns f4 fw3 lh-copy">Kumoru is an application management platform. It takes applications you write and gets them up on the Internet with no input required from you once it's up. After your application is in our system, we monitor its performance for you (based on metrics you define), and scale it to meet the demands of its load. We'll scale your application up when traffic spikes and then scale back down when traffic slows. This keeps your costs low, and mental overhead at zero.</p>

    <p class="f3-ns f4 fw3 lh-copy">Our hope is that at the end of the day, you can stop thinking about your applications the moment you deploy them. Focus on fixing bugs, adding features, and generally making things more awesome. Stop worrying about the performance of your infrastructure or if it will scale properly in the future. Let us take care of that for you.</p>

    <h3 class="f1-ns f2 k-dark-green">Let's get started:</h3>

    <p class="f3-ns f4 fw3 lh-copy">Kumoru requires a very basic understanding of Docker. All you need to know is how to take your application and create a Docker artifact. If you're new to Docker, we highly recommend the “Demystifying Docker” series, which covers artifact creation here:</p>

    <p class="f3-ns f4 fw3 lh-copy">Once you have a Docker artifact, you can drop it in to Kumoru and get your application up on the web. To learn how, watch this:</p>
